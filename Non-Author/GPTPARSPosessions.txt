Landon 
is a little gem that has been in my family for over a century. It was originally owned by my great-grandmother, who passed it down to her daughter, my grandmother, and then my mother. My mother gave it to me, when I was sixteen, and it has been my most prized possession ever since. 

The pen itself is simple but beautiful, made of silver and decorated with a small diamond in the center. However, it is the history and sentimental significance that make it so invaluable to me.
